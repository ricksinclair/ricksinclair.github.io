          <Tool title="16‚Äù MacBook Pro, M4 Max, 64GB RAM (2024)">
            This machine is an absolute beast‚Äî40-core GPU, 16-core CPU, and 2TB of blazing-fast SSD. It's quiet, cool, and handles everything from Docker containers to Logic Pro without breaking a sweat.
          </Tool>
          <Tool title="2019 iPad Pro 12.9‚Äù with Apple Pencil">
            Great for sketching, writing, and casual browsing. It also doubles as a side monitor thanks to Sidecar.

          <Tool title="Roland FP-30X Digital Piano">
            Full-weighted keys and solid onboard sounds‚Äîthis is my go-to for piano practice and MIDI input.
          </Tool>
          <Tool title="MPC Live II + MPK Mini Plus + Studio Monitors">
            Perfect combo for beat-making and music production. The Live II‚Äôs standalone capability pairs nicely with the MPK Mini for portability, and the monitors keep everything sounding clean.
          </Tool>

        <ToolsSection title="Development tools">
          <Tool title="VS Code + Cursor">

          </Tool>
          <Tool title="JetBrains IDEs (WebStorm, IntelliJ IDEA)">
            When I need the heavy artillery for complex projects. The refactoring tools and intelligent code assistance are unmatched, especially for TypeScript and Java projects.
          </Tool>
          <Tool title="Warp">
            The terminal that convinced me terminals could actually be fun. With its block-based structure, AI command suggestions, and collaborative features, it's like having a chatty assistant who never judges you for forgetting how to exit vim... again.
          </Tool>
        </ToolsSection>
        <ToolsSection title="Design">
          <Tool title="Figma">
            We started using Figma as just a design tool but now it‚Äôs become our
            virtual whiteboard for the entire company. Never would have expected
            the collaboration features to be the real hook.

          </Tool>
          <Tool title="MPC 3.5">
            The inception setup: MPC software running as a VST inside Logic while my Live II acts as the controller, sometimes with the Roland or MPK Mini thrown in for good measure. It's beautifully chaotic‚ÄîMPC controlling MPC while Logic records it all.
          </Tool>
          <Tool title="Splice">
            My go-to for fresh samples and sounds. The subscription keeps me stocked with everything from obscure vinyl chops to modern trap kits when inspiration strikes at 2 AM.

          <Tool title="ü§ñ Why I Have All These AI Tools">
            Look, if AI is coming for my job (and let's be honest, it probably is), then I'm going to make sure I can at least direct the takeover. Think of it as career insurance with a side of existential dread. I'm not just learning to code‚ÄîI'm learning to speak fluent AI. Because if robots are going to replace me, I want to be the human whispering sweet prompts in their digital ears. Plus, mastering prompt and context engineering means I can either work for myself or help others navigate our inevitable AI overlords. It's like learning to ride the wave instead of getting swept away by it. üèÑ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
